This repository contains a simple COBOL program demonstrating a common off-by-one error in loops. The program initializes a counter to 0 and then uses a PERFORM...VARYING statement to increment the counter 10 times. However, due to an incorrect loop condition, the counter ends up being incremented 11 times instead.

The bug is explained in detail, and a solution is provided that corrects the loop condition to ensure it iterates the correct number of times.  This is a common error found in COBOL and other imperative programming languages when using loops and counters.
